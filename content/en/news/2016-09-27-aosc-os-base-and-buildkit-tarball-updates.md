title: AOSC OS Base and BuildKit Tarball Updates
---


Tarballs for AOSC OS Base (bare-metal variant) and BuildKit (packaging/development variant) are updated yesterday for all supported architectures - you may now obtain them via the ["GET AOSC OS"](/en-us/download#aosc-os-download) link above.

Significant changes to the tarballs include:

- AOSC OS Core version of these tarballs have been updated to [4.0.1](/en-us/news/2016-09-24-core-401-released) (you might also want to check out the release announcement of [4.0.0](/en-us/news/2016-09-18-aosc-os-core-4-is-green)).
- ARM64 tarballs for Base and BuildKit are now ready for use, and the "Experimental" notes are removed.

Some changes to the "GET AOSC OS" page were made as well:

- Finally, we've got screenshot for Base and BuildKit.
- "MIPS" has been renamed as "MIPS32" to avoid confusion.
